üéôÔ∏è Flipkart UI Engineer interview - My experience

Over the last year, some people have asked me about the UI interview process at Flipkart. I might have said I will write back in some time, but never got around to writing. Sorry for that! 

Here's a detailed version -
üìû  A recruiting agency (Interviewbit) contacted me and setup the onsite. There was no screening round, it was directly onsite. About 10-12 candidates were invited to apply for the same role, on a weekend. 
(Flipkart loves this group interview thing through agencies, and that is your best shot of getting to the door. Most of the colleagues i have heard from also got in through similar route. Its sad, but referral is almost useless here and gets ignored most of the time.) 

üìÖ  The interview was mostly a one-day process - from morning to late evening. First, they asked us to gather in a meeting room and explained the machine coding task (1st round). Next rounds are ps/ds (problem solving + data structure), UI round and finally, manager round. 

Machine coding - This is a UI you have to build using plain html/css/js - no ui library like react or vue is allowed. There is a list of reqd and good to have features. Complete atleast some of them. But more focus is on clean coding, best practices and logic, rather than on the ui look. 
Example task -  Consider a todo app. You can add, edit, remove items
Think beforehand how you want to build using plain js, keeping it modular and everything. Have a scaffolding with import/export support ready (webpack or something).


Ps/ds - 1 problem solving question (leetcode easy problem - sorting, find from both sides, etc) + 1 data structure question (ex. tree traversal starting from leaf, stack, etc) . 
This is not so hard (usually) for ui roles, but i have heard if you are unlucky interviewer might go full-blown sde level like red-black tree.
There is officially no distinction for psds round for ui roles, but practically there is

UI+Js - most imp round (i felt), expect somewhat advanced js + browser related questions (debounce, event handling with delegation, event capturing phase, scope, let/var, promise + promise.all, async, how does a page load from start, etc) 

Manager round - Depends. Some HR questions (why you want to move / join), mostly tech questions.
For me it was - how authentication, cookies, what all cookie contains, react new version, how do you learn, etc
