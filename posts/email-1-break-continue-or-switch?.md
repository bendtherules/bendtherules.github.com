Welcome back to the second issue. This is that time of the weekend when I try to put on a writer's hat and spend hours looking for that perfect opening Gif üòÄ.

And guess what's special today? Happy Mother's Day üë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶!

Now, back to our topic -

We will talk about a few separate but interesting bits today. We'll start with control flow statements (like break, return), then look at the wild side of switch-case statements and wrap it up with some animation I built just yesterday.

# Control flow statements
What's common between `continue`, `break`, `return` and `throw`?  
They are all control flow statements and internally, return a [completion record](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-completion-record-specification-type). 

Statements within a block of code are normally run one-by-one and the process ends when the last statement has finished execution. Control flow statements change that normal order of execution. They let us exit prematurely or jump back to a different block of code. This is known as non-local transfer of control.

<!--
‚¨ÜÔ∏è It might be hard to think of `return` statements as "exiting prematurely". After all, that's how we are supposed to return any value from a function.  

But the other way of thinking is that return is a user-specified way of exiting from any part of the function body, with a specific value. `return` can be used in the middle of a function, not just at the end.
-->

**Completion record** is a internal data structure (called as record) which holds the following fields and their values -  

a. [[Type]] - Possible values are normal, break, continue, return, or throw. Ex - when we write `break;`, it returns a completion record with [[Type]] = 'break'

b. [[Value]] - Completion records can contain a value to store what data was returned. If not provided, it defaults to `undefined`.  
Ex - when we write `throw foo;`, it returns a completion record with [[Type]] = 'throw', [[Value]] = foo.  
Similarly, when we write a return statement, the return value is stored within this field.

c. [[Target]] - This is a lesser used construct. continue and break statements can have a optional label - which looks like `break foo;`. This label 'foo' is stored in [[Target]] field.

How does `break foo;` work?
